# Digital Weight Latest FW for V4

## Release Date

June 2024, as demonstrated at open sauce SF

## Overview

Two separate esp32 controllers. One as the master state machine for the device. The other only serves as a control input from the screen and controller knob.

## Odrive compiled firmware to be added

Note I have received soft confirmation from ODrive team that it is likely possible for us to obtain the source firmware and PCB files from their team. This could allow us to branch and create a cost optimized controller for our application and possibly directly use the odrive mcu for some of our higher-level control functions
